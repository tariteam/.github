We are a developer community. Where we want to create anything we can imagine and then start trying to make it. But our biggest criterion is that our products are useful to users and safe.

### üìñ The project we are doing:
- **Waifu & Services** : This is a discord bot. Which we want to connect to other services like app, web, api,...
### üåê What will we do in the future:
- **Protector** : Like Waifu, this is also a bot. We plan to develop this bot to protect you on Discord. Specially inspired by the ChongLuaDao project, we wanted to generate commands to help you check links, bots or users directly from Discord.
- **Zin Mp3** : A music web player with fast speed, friendly interface,...
- **Wifer** : A app on computer to to check the security of the network you are using.
